This part is some experimental stuff to replace the address of a 
symbol in the symbol table. 

Use ./setsym [new address] [symbol name] in order to give the symbol
a new address. The address you specify is from the offset of the relocation
address of the linker file where this symbol is at home. For symbols
from /kernel this will just be 0.

You can test your changed with findsym [symbol name] from the tools directory.
Note that this doesn't have any effect on the stuff that's currently running.
Only if someone checks this manually or a new module etc gets linked, do those
symbols get resolved.

Use with care ;)
